# Risk-Assessment-for-Life-Insurance
The main objective of this project is risk assessment of the people applying for a Life Insurance. 
I built a model that categorize the people into one of the eight classes by their personal demographics,
insurance history and employment history. From the allotted class, we get to know the risk of a person. 
The data set was obtained from Kaggle.
